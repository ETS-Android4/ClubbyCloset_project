# ClubbyCloset_project

ClubbyCloset is a project presented for Human-Computer Interactions elective from the M.Sc. in Eng. in Computer Science at "La Sapienza" University of Rome.
ClubbyCloset is a mobile application that allows you to find ideas and share advice about outfits to be worn in different circumstances.
Differently from other existing and established apps, we want to focus more on the context of the event and on the personâ€™s style and characteristics than on the brand or on who recommends it (influencers typically).
